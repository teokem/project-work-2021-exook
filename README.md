When the Binder server is running, before running the notebook, start a terminal to extract and decrypt data.zip.

On the right there is a drop down menu called "New", click it and select "Terminal". A new browser tab will open with a command line. Enter: "7z x data.zip". When promted, enter the password given to you by me. This will extract and decrypt teh data for the notebook. Close the terminal broswer tab.
